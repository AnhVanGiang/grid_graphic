# Grid Graphic
## How to run
run main.py
## How to use
Left click to color a pixel (box) red or hold left click and drag to color multiple pixels red.
Hold "b" and drag left mouse button to color multiple pixels black. These black boxes can act as walls in graph algorithms. 
If "b" is clicked, everything will be drawn in black until b is clicked again then the color returns to red.  
To use the graph algorithms mainly Dijkstra and A*, color two pixels red and draw the walls (if you want) and press "s" for Dijkstra and "t" for A*.  
If there are more than 2 red pixels then the program will only use the last 2.  
While the board is being drawn my the algo, walls can be drawn and will be taken into account by the algo.
